# BlockTridiagonalOpenCL
This is an OpenCL implementation of a fast algorithm for computing the largest eigenvalue of symmetric block tridiagonal matrices.

The fast algorithm is based on the computation of matrix squaring using the symmetries of the input matrix. The method is intended to speed up the Power iteration for finding the largest eigenvalue of the input matrix.
